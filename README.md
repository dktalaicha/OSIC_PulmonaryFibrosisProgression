# OSIC_PulmonaryFibrosisProgression

**Objective**

The aim of this competition is to predict a patientâ€™s severity of decline in lung function based on a CT scan of their lungs. Lung function is assessed based on output from a spirometer, which measures the forced vital capacity (FVC), i.e. the volume of air exhaled. The challenge is to use machine learning techniques to make a prediction with the image, metadata, and baseline FVC as input.
